Here's the optimized implementation checklist following your requirements:

- [x] 1. Create Next.js page component with viewport meta tags and CSS Grid layout (Base Page)
- [x] 2. Add HTML5 canvas element with dynamic sizing and resize observer (Canvas Setup)
- [x] 3. Implement frame context types and SDK initialization (Frame Context)
- [x] 4. Fetch user's pfp from frame metadata with CORS proxy (Image Loading)
- [x] 5. Create pink overlay drawing function with multiply composite (Colorization)
- [x] 6. Set up requestAnimationFrame loop for dynamic updates (Performance)
- [x] 7. Add range input component with mobile touch styling (Slider UI)
- [x] 8. Implement useState + localStorage for intensity value (State Management)
- [x] 9. Connect slider value to overlay alpha via useEffect (Real-time Updates)
- [x] 10. Add color clamping and state serialization logic (Data Integrity)
- [x] 11. Create canvas.toDataURL export function (Image Export)
- [x] 12. Implement download button with dynamic filename (Export UX)
- [x] 13. Add touch-action: none and passive listeners (Touch Optimization)
- [x] 14. Configure CSS media queries for aspect ratios (Responsive Layout)
- [x] 15. Wire frame metadata validation and fallbacks (Error Handling)
- [x] 16. Connect download button click handler (Final Wiring)
- [x] 17. Implement localStorage sync on mount (State Persistence)
- [x] 18. Add visual feedback animations for interactions (UI Polish)
- [x] 19. Validate responsive behavior across breakpoints (Testing)
- [ ] 20. Add loading state during image fetch (UX Enhancement)

This checklist follows implementation order:
1. Structural components (1-3)
2. Data flow (4-6) 
3. Interaction layer (7-10)
4. Export system (11-12)
5. Mobile optimization (13-14)
6. Integration and polish (15-20)

Each task completes a specific functional requirement while building on previous implementations. Completing all 20 will result in a fully functional frame meeting all specified requirements without overlap or missing functionality.
